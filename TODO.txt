    FIX ERROR Handling
    PARALLELIZE INTENSIVE SEGMENTS (PROFILE THE CODE)
    OPTIMIZE PASSING OF DATA STRUCTURES BETWEEN FUNCTIONS
    ADDING ERROR TO MISSING ELEMENTS IN ERROR COLUMN:
        median of ( error(i) * sqrt(n_i) ) for other columns that have error

0.  in plotting, make axis limits and tick marks general
3.  batch fitting with correlation coefficients
4.  bootstrapping with plotting confidence range
5.  simulation of functions of fit parameters
7.  ability to select a subset of data (and from which dataset) for fit or plotting
9.  integrate bootstrap results plotting (distribution and correlation)
10. normalize columns of same header in different files (overlay std footprinting from different gels)
11. Dataset function to read in data files
12. Replace lsqcurvefit with fmincon to be able to fix parameter values (equal upper and lower bounds)
        Use Hessian to get confidence intervals
